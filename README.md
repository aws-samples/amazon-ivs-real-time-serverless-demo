# Amazon IVS Real-time Serverless Demo

A serverless demo intended as an educational tool to demonstrate how you can build an application that enables real-time social UGC (User Generated Content) use cases using Amazon IVS Stages and Amazon IVS Chat. This README includes instructions for deploying the Amazon IVS Real-time Serverless demo to an AWS Account.

_IMPORTANT NOTE: Deploying this demo application in your AWS account will create and consume AWS resources, which will cost money._

## Prerequisites

- [AWS CLI Version 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and `npm` (npm is usually installed with NodeJS)
  - If you have [node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed, run `nvm use` to sync your node version with this project
- Access to an AWS Account with at least the following permissions:
  - Create IAM Roles
  - Create Lambda Functions
  - Create Secret Manager Secrets
  - Create Amazon IVS Stages and Chat Rooms
  - Create Amazon DynamoDB Tables
  - Create EventBridge Rules
  - Create Step Functions State Machines

For configuration specifics, refer to the [AWS CLI User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html).

## Architecture

## Deploying the backend stack

1. If this is your first time deploying the backend stack, run the following command:

   ```
   make app STACK=YOUR_STACK_NAME (default: IVSRealTimeDemo)
   ```

   Otherwise, run the following command to skip the `install` and `bootstrap` processes and go straight into deploying:

   ```
   make deploy STACK=YOUR_STACK_NAME (default: IVSRealTimeDemo)
   ```

   See [Commands](#commands) for a comprehensive list of the `app` and `deploy` options.

2. Press `y` when prompted to acknowledge and proceed with the deployment

## Using the deployed backend with the client applications

When the deployment successfully completes, copy the `‚≠êÔ∏è Customer ID` and `üîë API key` values outputted in your terminal session. On your mobile device, simply enter these values when prompted by the app.

Alternatively, you may use the mobile app to scan the `üîé Authentication QR code`. Doing so will automatically paste the customer ID and API key into the app and sign you in immediately.

## Tearing down the backend stack

To delete a deployed backend stack, run the following command:

```
make destroy STACK=YOUR_STACK_NAME
```

See [Commands](#commands) for a comprehensive list of the `destroy` option.

_Note: resources created after the deployment will not be deleted. Such resources may include Stages and Chat Rooms._
